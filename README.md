3. `Visual_inspection.ipynb` -- visual inspection of TAD boundaries and fountains on the same Hi-C maps
4. `Overlap.ipynb` -- testing the 'overlapping' hypothesis (between TAD boundaries and fountains)
5. `Calculate_insulation.ipynb` -- calculating insulation scores for the subsequent clustering (both TAD boundaries and fountains)
6. `Clustering.ipynb` -- clustering of TAD boundaries and fountains in time of embryogenesis
7. `Calculate_distance.ipynb` -- testing the 'distance' hypothesis (TADs come after fountains) -- **NOT YET FINISHED** (index error)
